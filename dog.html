    <h1>Interesting Facts About Dogs</h1>
    <h2>Did you know that dogs have 18 muscles to move their ears!</h2>
    <img src="images/ear_fluffy.jpg" alt="Dogs have many muscles in their ears">
    <p>This allows dogs to move their ears in intricate ways, which is important to picking up sounds.</p>
    <p>Plus, your dogs ears can give you a clue as to how they're feeling: If they're laying flat back against their head, your pooch may be scared. If they're pointing straight up, they're alert and on the case.</p>
    <h2>Dogs can Dream!</h2>
    <img src="images/sleepy_dog.jpg" alt="Dogs can dream in their sleep">
    <p>Not only do dogs dream as they sleep, scientists think that they dream similarly to us and replay moments from their day.</p>
    <p> You can tell that a dog is dreaming if they are twitching their legs or bark in their sleep. Additionally, small dogs have more dreams than big dogs.</p>
    <h2>Dogs Sweat through their paws!</h2>
    <img src="images/sweaty_dog.jpg" alt="Dogs sweat through their paws">
    <p>Dogs have sweat glands only on their paws, not the rest of their bodies. </p>
    <p>That little surface area isn't enough to cool them down, however, which is why they ventilate and exchange heat through panting.</p>
